# AuraCheck  
**AI Secure Attendance Tracking System**  

## Project Goals  

### Provide Real-Time Attendance Information  
- Enable students to view their attendance records instantly through the app.  
- Display detailed data, such as attendance percentages for each subject.  

### Automate Attendance Input  
- ~~Integrate with the university database to automatically record and update attendance data.~~ *(Not important)*  
- Eliminate manual attendance entry and minimize errors.  

### User-Friendly Interface  
- Simple and interactive design.  

### Improve Efficiency, Accuracy, and Enable Anti-Cheat  
- Enable Prof/TA to open attendance whenever they like (e.g., mid-lecture, at the end of the lecture).  
- Provide the option to make attendance open for a fixed duration (e.g., 10 minutes, 20 minutes).  
- Require students to confirm attendance using **GPS and Fingerprint (biometric cryptographic key)**.  

## Draft  

### Customizable Notifications  
- Notify students about attendance updates, warnings for low attendance, or upcoming lectures.  

- ~~Scalability and Flexibility:~~ *(Not important right now)*  
  - Allow for future enhancements, such as integrating additional features like course schedules or exam reminders.
